WP Footnotes
============

A footnotes plugin for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) which allows authors to easily add footnotes to any post using 
a simple mark-up which degrades (kind of) gracefully in the event that for some horrifying reason this plugin no longer 
works.

Installation & Usage
--------------------

Installation is best handled from within the WordPress admin area, but you can [download the latest release from the 
WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-footnotes/).

[Documentation on using WP-Footnotes](http://elvery.net/drzax/wordpress-footnotes-plugin) is at 
[sw'as](http://elvery.net/drzax) (the author's website). Further support is crowd sourced via the 
[WordPress support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-footnotes).
